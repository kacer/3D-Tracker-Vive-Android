# Android app for 3D trackers compatible with HTC Vive
This mobile application was created within my master thesis where I was creating a small device called [3D tracker](https://github.com/kacer/3D-Tracker-Vive) which is capable of tracking its position in the world with HTC Vive Base Stations. The primary purpose of this app is to allow the user to see the position of 3D trackers in space and the possibility of configuring 3D trackers.

The mobile app is divided into two user roles - admin and user. A regular user is able to start scanning nearby 3D trackers, connect and disconnect with them and see positions of connected 3D trackers and HTC Base Stations in the 3D scene. Moreover in admin mode user can work with the geometry of 3D trackers which consists of the position of base station and its rotation matrix. Admin can load geometry from txt file into the application and then send this geometry to connected 3D trackers.

The demo of position tracking by two 3D trackers on YouTube:
